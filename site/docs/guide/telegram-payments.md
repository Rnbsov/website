# Telegram Payments

## Introduction

Bot Payments API is a free and open platform that allows bots to accept payments from Telegram users. You can send checks to users in any chat room, be it a group or a channel. You can see a full list of features [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots/payments#introducing-payments-2-0). It is also worth noting that Telegram has no access to card data in any way and does not charge a fee for payments and uses payment providers, more on this below.

::: tip Compatibility with devices
To access **Payments 2.0**, users must have **Telegram 7.7** or higher. For the desktop version, it must be **2.7.2** or higher.

Outdated _mobile_ apps released after May 2017 only support basic chat payments with bots.
